<h1>Dropbox homepage copy</h1>

<p>The assignment was to recreate Dropbox homepage, the <a href="#ref-image">image</a> attached at the bottom of this readme as a reference.</p>
<p>The goal was to be able to do it using only Html and CSS knowledges, without any JS, libraries, or frameworks.
What I used were instead 
<ul>
  <li>
    My knowledges of basics html tags
  </li>
  <li>
    CSS classes creations, selectors and pseudoselectors 
  </li>
  <li>
    Flexbox
  </li>
  <li>
    Position absolute and relative
  </li>
 </ul>
 
 After I achived a good result on copying the reference I added some hover effects, acrive effects and transitions, to achieve a better User Experience.
 
 In the end I created a secondary CSS for dark mode theme.
