<h1>Dropbox homepage copy</h1>

<p>The assignment was to recreate Dropbox homepage, the <a href="#ref-image">image</a> attached at the bottom of this readme as a reference or at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210121192759/https://www.dropbox.com/it/business">this link.</a></p>

<p>The goal was to be able to do it using only Html and CSS knowledges, without any JS, libraries, or frameworks.
What I used were instead: 
<ul>
  <li>
    My knowledges of basics html tags.
  </li>
  <li>
    CSS classes, advanced selectors and pseudoselectors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Flexbox.
  </li>
  <li>
    Position absolute and relative.
  </li>
    <li>
    CSS Animations.
  </li>
 </ul>
 
 The original website font is a closed copyright one, so I used Open Sans from Google Fonts.

After I achieved a good result on copying the reference I added some hover effects, active effects and transitions, to get a better User Experience.

In the end I created a secondary CSS for dark mode theme using some variables for the section's colors.
